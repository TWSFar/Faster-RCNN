        Propose RoIs.

        Inputs :obj:`loc, score, anchor` refer to the same anchor when indexed
        by the same index.

        On notations, :math:`R` is the total number of anchors. This is equal
        to product of the height and the width of an image and the number of
        anchor bases per pixel.

        Type of the output is same as the inputs.

        Args:
            loc (array): Predicted offsets and scaling to anchors.
                Its shape is :math:`(R, 4)`.
            score (array): Predicted foreground probability for anchors.
                Its shape is :math:`(R,)`.
            anchor (array): Coordinates of anchors. Its shape is
                :math:`(R, 4)`.
            img_size (tuple of ints): A tuple :obj:`height, width`,
                which contains image size after scaling.
            scale (float): The scaling factor used to scale an image after
                reading it from a file.

        Returns:
            array:
            An array of coordinates of proposal boxes.
            Its shape is :math:`(S, 4)`. :math:`S` is less than
            :obj:`self.n_test_post_nms` in test time and less than
            :obj:`self.n_train_post_nms` in train time. :math:`S` depends on
            the size of the predicted bounding boxes and the number of
            bounding boxes discarded by NMS.
